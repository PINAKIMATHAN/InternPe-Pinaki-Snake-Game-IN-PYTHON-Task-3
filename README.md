InternPe-Pinaki-Snake-Game-IN-PYTHON-Task-3

After completing the snake game in Python, I felt a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. Developing this classic arcade-style game not only honed my coding skills but also provided a fun and engaging project to work on. Seeing the snake slither across the screen, gobbling up apples and growing longer with each bite, was incredibly rewarding. It's amazing how a few lines of code can bring a game to life and provide hours of entertainment. Now, with the game completed, I look forward to sharing it with friends and family, knowing that I've created something enjoyable from scratch as per the task of InternPe i.e., Python Development ----TASK-3.
